To use the boilerplate code scripts you need to run

 $ make install

This wont install anything outside of the unpacked
boilerplate project directory, it just processes
any *.in files to fix the location of these files.

Additionally you can modify your .bashrc script
to source the boilerplate/bashrc script.
